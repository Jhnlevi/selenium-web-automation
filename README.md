## Selenium Web Automation

Welcome to my Selenium Web Automation portfolio! This repository contains my automation projects demonstrating end to end (E2E) testing using Selenium WebDriver, C#, and NUnit. Each project follows best practices like the Page Object Model (POM) structure, data driven testing, and detailed reporting.


## Projects:

### [OrangeHRM Demo - Automation project](OrangeHRMTests/README.md):

Automates core workflows on the [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) website. Beginner project no. 2 practicing Selenium automation, data driven testing (DDT), and test reporting.

Highlights:

- Automated UI tests using Selenium & Page Object Model.
- Data driven tests with JSON for multiple scenarios.
- Reliable automation with custom waits for stable tests.
- Screenshots & HTML reports for easy debugging.
- CI ready setup for automated test execution.

### [SauceDemo - Automation project](SauceDemoTests/README.md):

Automates workflows on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) website. Beginner project no. 1 for Selenium automation, data-driven testing, and reporting.

Highlights:

- End to end (E2E) flows: login, product selection, cart management, and checkout.
- Data driven tests with JSON.
- Detailed HTML reporting and screenshots.

### Selenium Automation Toolkit - NuGet Package:

A personal C# Selenium automation toolkit for web testing and browser automation, built on .NET.

*Note: This is a private NuGet package.*

Includes:

- 'DriverFactory' - Create, get, and close WebDriver instance easily
- 'ScreenshotManager' - Capture screenshots for reports
- 'ReportManager' - Generate, and log test reports
- 'JsonLoader' - Load test data from JSON files for data-driven testing
- 'JsonReader' - Read and parse JSON files into usable test data objects
- 'ConfigLoader' – Load configuration settings from appsettings.json

*(Future projects will be added here as I expand my portfolio)*

## Technologies Used:

- Selenium WebDriver
- C# (.NET)
