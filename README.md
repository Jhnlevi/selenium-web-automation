# Levi's Selenium Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my Selenium Web Automation portfolio! This repository contains my automation projects demonstrating end-to-end (E2E) testing using Selenium WebDriver, C#, and NUnit. Each project follows best practices like the Page Object Model (POM) structure, data-driven testing, and detailed reporting.

## Projects

#### [SauceDemo Website - Automation](SauceDemoTests/README.md)
- Automates key workflows on the demo Saucedemo website
- Features: login, product selection, cart management, checkout flow
- Data-driven tests with JSON and HTML reporting

#### [Utilities](TestUtilities/README.md)
- provides a set of helper classes to simplify Selenium test automation.

*(Future projects will be added here as I expand my portfolio)*

## Technologies Used

- Selenium WebDriver
- C# (.NET)
- NUnit 3
- JSON (for test data)
- Git/GitHub
- Page Object Model (POM)
