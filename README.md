## Selenium Web Automation Repository

Welcome to my Selenium Web Automation portfolio! This repository contains my automation projects demonstrating end-to-end (E2E) testing using Selenium WebDriver, C#, and NUnit. Each project follows best practices like the Page Object Model (POM) structure, data-driven testing, and detailed reporting.

## Projects:

### [SauceDemo Website - Automation](SauceDemoTests/README.md)

Automates key workflows on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) website.

Highlights:

- End-to-end (E2E) flows: login, product selection, cart management, and checkout.
- Data-driven tests with JSON.
- Detailed HTML reporting and screenshots.

### [Test Utilities](TestUtilities/README.md)

Reusable helper classes to simplify Selenium test automation.

Includes:

- WebDriver management and factory
- Custom waits
- Screenshots and report generation
- Test result logging
- ConfigReader for appsettings.json

*(Future projects will be added here as I expand my portfolio)*

## Technologies Used:

- Selenium WebDriver
- C# (.NET)
- NUnit 3
- JSON (for test data)
- Git/GitHub
- Page Object Model (POM)
