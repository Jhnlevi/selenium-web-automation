## Selenium Web Automation

Welcome to my Selenium Web Automation portfolio! This repository contains my automation projects demonstrating end to end (E2E) testing using Selenium WebDriver, C#, and NUnit. Each project follows best practices like the Page Object Model (POM) structure, data driven testing, and detailed reporting.


## Projects:

### [OrangeHRM Demo - Automation project](OrangeHRMTests/README.md):

Automates core workflows on the [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) website. Beginner project no. 2 practicing Selenium automation, data driven testing (DDT), and test reporting.

Highlights:

- Automated UI tests using Selenium & Page Object Model.
- Data driven tests with JSON for multiple scenarios.
- Reliable automation with custom waits for stable tests.
- Screenshots & HTML reports for easy debugging.
- CI ready setup for automated test execution.

### [SauceDemo - Automation project](SauceDemoTests/README.md):

Automates workflows on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) website. Beginner project no. 1 for Selenium automation, data-driven testing, and reporting.

Highlights:

- End to end (E2E) flows: login, product selection, cart management, and checkout.
- Data driven tests with JSON.
- Detailed HTML reporting and screenshots.

### [Test Utilities - Class library project](TestUtilities/README.md):

A beginner library project of reusable helpers for Selenium automation, including WebDriver management, custom waits, JSON data handling, screenshots, and test reporting.

Includes:

- WebDriverFactory: Easily create, get, and close WebDriver instances.
- Custom Waits: Centralized wait methods for stable tests.
- ScreenshotHelper: Capture screenshots automatically during tests.
- ReportManager: Generate simple HTML reports with test results.
- TestDataLoader / Reader: Load and read JSON test data for multiple scenarios.
- TestConfigReader: Manage environment URLs, credentials, and settings via appsettings.json

*(Future projects will be added here as I expand my portfolio)*
